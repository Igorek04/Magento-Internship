Stripe offers two plugins for Adobe Commerce and Magento open source:

* You can use the Stripe Payments, Billing, and Tax plugin to accept payments from a wide selection of payment methods and to automate tax calculation and reporting.
* You can use the Stripe Tax plugin to automate tax calculation and reporting if you don’t use Stripe to accept payments.
